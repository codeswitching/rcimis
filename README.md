An R package to download and process CIMIS (California Irrigation Management System) data

CIMIS is a network of weather stations throughout California that record hourly data on temperature, precipitation, windspeed, humidity, solar radiation, and reference evapotranspiration. This package provides simple functions to fetch data from the CIMIS API and store it in a tidy data frame. Users must have an API key, which can be obtained from the CIMIS website after registering for an account.
